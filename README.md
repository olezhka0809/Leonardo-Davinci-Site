# Leonardo da Vinci Website

This is my first project created using HTML and CSS. The website is dedicated to Leonardo da Vinci and provides a simple yet coherent presentation of his life, works, and contributions. The site includes various sections such as Home, About, History, Portfolio, and Contacts.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive, with a dedicated mobile menu that appears when the viewport width is below 480px.
- **Navigation:** The site includes a header with navigation links to different sections and a mobile-friendly burger menu for easy access on smaller screens.
- **Content Sections:**
  - **Home:** Introduction and overview of Leonardo da Vinci.
  - **About:** Detailed information about Leonardo da Vinci's life and achievements.
  - **History:** Information about Leonardo's early life and background.
  - **Portfolio:** A gallery of Leonardo da Vinci's notable works with descriptions.
  - **Contacts:** Links to external resources and social media profiles.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
